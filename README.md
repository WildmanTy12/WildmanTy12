# 👋 Hi, I'm Tyson Wildman

I’m an **Associate Supervisor** on the **Escalations Team at DoorDash**, focused on building workflow automations and AI tools that make complex operations simple.  
I blend technical curiosity with process optimization — turning manual tasks into scalable, data-driven systems.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- 🧩 **Automation Design:** Building custom workflows using Google Apps Script, Python, and API integrations  
- 🧮 **AI + Analytics:** Leveraging OpenAI, data pipelines, and reporting dashboards for smarter decisions  
- ⚙️ **Operational Efficiency:** Turning repeated processes into reliable automations that scale

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [AI Trend Reporting Demo](https://github.com/wildmanty12/ai-trend-reporting-demo)
📊 *Sanitized version of a production system I built for internal escalation analytics.*  
- Automates classification, trend detection, and insight generation  
- Runs entirely in Google Sheets using Apps Script + GPT integration  
- Includes demo data, mock AI fills, and a real linked [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EAt_su3pJSGNPNJRGPI2qYGIKIHx88k7z81xlGLh0v8/edit?usp=sharing)

### Task Tracker CLI (Python)
🖥️ A lightweight command-line task manager built with beginner-to-pro Python refactors in mind.  
Focuses on learning clean structure, logic nesting, and data persistence.

### Automation Experiments
⚡ A growing collection of scripts that automate small but repetitive ops tasks — from data validation to API-based updates.
